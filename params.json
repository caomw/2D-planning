Two approaches are implemented in this package\r\n1. uniform grid over map\r\n2. quadtree decomposition over the map\r\nPlanning algorithm is A* search\r\n\r\n#video of quadtree decomposition:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqjlsIAQDT0\r\n\r\nvisualization use ROS markers in rviz\r\n\r\n#COMPILATION:\r\nCmake file is provided.\r\n$ cmake .\r\n$ make\r\n\r\nOnly the visualization part depends on ROS rviz package.
