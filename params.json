Two approaches are implemented in this package\r\n\r\n1. uniform grid over map\r\n2. **quadtree** decomposition over the map\r\n\r\nPlanning algorithm is A* search\r\n\r\n## video of quadtree decomposition:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqjlsIAQDT0\r\nvisualization in ROS in rviz\r\n\r\n## COMPILATION:\r\nCmake file is provided.\r\n$ cmake .\r\n$ make\r\n\r\nOnly the visualization part depends on ROS rviz package. Other part of the code are stand alone. If you don't have ROS installed, simply comment out the visualization part of the code in run_planner.cpp.\r\n\r\n## HOW TO RUN:\r\n./run_planner <map path> \r\nwhich generate intermidiate text file for output.\r\n\r\n## NOTE:\r\nThis implementaion assume obstacles are all circles\r\n\r\n## Contact:\r\nMenglong Zhu, menglong AT cis upenn edu\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
